# FFR Vision Studio (Windows app)

The native front of the studio: a Flutter desktop app that downloads and supervises the Python/.NET engine
(`FFR Vision Studio Engine.exe`, fetched from the project's host on first start) and drives its Easy mode natively.
This repository is the app on its own: it needs nothing else on disk to build, and at runtime it talks only to the
engine over localhost and to the host over HTTPS. Design: `DESIGN.md` and `lib/design/DIRECTION.md`. The engine's
source, the pack builder and the project notes live in a separate project repository, which is not published yet.

## Build

```
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build windows --release            # defaults to version 1.0.0, build 15
```

A build talks to the live host, which can require a minimum app version in its manifest. This branch defaults to build 15
in both the executable metadata and the app's version check. To use another compatible build number:

```
flutter build windows --release --build-name 1.0.0 --build-number <n> \
  --dart-define=APP_VERSION=1.0.0 --dart-define=APP_BUILD=<n>
```

`.github/workflows/windows.yml` on this fork's development branch runs analyze, test and the Windows build on pushes to
`Sephira's-Update`, `main`, and `master`, as well as pull requests. It attaches the Release folder as the
`FFR-Vision-Studio-windows` artifact. Automatic builds default to build 15 and check the host's minimum-version requirement.
A manual run ("Run workflow") can supply a different compatible build number.
If GitHub Actions is disabled on the fork, enable it from the repository's Actions page first. The zips people
download are assembled by the packaging run in the project repository, which passes the same flags and ships the
exe next to the engine and the data packs.

## Cloud builds

From this checkout, use the helper to build the development branch and download the resulting Windows app:

```
python3 scripts/cloud_windows_build.py --enable-actions
```

The first run can enable repository Actions. Later runs can omit `--enable-actions`.
The helper defaults to `Sephira's-Update` and build 15, checks the remote commit, waits for its workflow run, and downloads
only that run's `FFR-Vision-Studio-windows` artifact. It writes a provenance record alongside the executable under
`/workspace/.runtime/ffr/builds`. Commit and push changes before building them.

The platform's GitHub integration may allow code pushes while denying Actions administration. In that case, supply a
fine-grained GitHub token securely as `FFR_GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN` in the cloud environment's secret settings, scoped only
to `biscoBen/FFR-Vison-Studio`. It needs **Actions: read and write** to enable workflows, request builds, watch runs, and
download artifacts; **Contents: read** to verify the selected commit; and **Administration: read and write** for the
one-time repository Actions activation. Administration permission can be removed after activation.
The helper uses the existing injected GitHub authentication when this additional binding is absent. Never put token
values in the repository or chat.

Use `--ref master` to download a separate baseline build without changing or merging `master`.
Run the downloaded executable through the prepared Wine runtime with separate scratch application data.
Full mod tests still need the game's installation and extracted data.

## Layout

- `lib/main.dart` window, single-instance lock, header, engine-down banner
- `lib/state/app_state.dart` boot (downloads, offline start, update notice), engine supervision, units, build, restore
- `lib/services/` engine process, downloader (resume + checksum), engine API client, game folder detection, paths
- `lib/design/` the guide's tokens (`Guide`, day and night editions), parts, wordmark, motion viewer, choice
- `lib/screens/` setup, home (spread), unit page and its four steps, add-unit, copy-a-vision, about, build status
- `windows/runner/Runner.rc` exe metadata; `windows/runner/resources/app_icon.ico` Rain's face

## Developing without touching your real install

Start the built exe with `LOCALAPPDATA` pointed at a scratch folder: the app keeps everything (engine, packs, units, logs)
under `<LOCALAPPDATA>\FFR Vision Studio`. `FFR_STUDIO_HOST` points it at another host tree (a local copy served on
127.0.0.1, for instance); it defaults to the live host, which is all a developer build needs.

To compare `Sephira's-Update` with a clean `master` build, keep the executables in separate folders and give each its own
scratch `LOCALAPPDATA` directory. This separates settings, engine files, and units. On Linux, run the Windows build
through Wine or Proton; compiling the Windows executable still requires Windows. Keep `master` unchanged when testing
the development branch.

## Files

`CHANGELOG.md` (by build), `LICENSE` (MIT for the code; the game's art and data are Square Enix's and excluded),
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/workflows/windows.yml` (analyze, test, build, artifact on every push).
